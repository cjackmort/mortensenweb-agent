/**
 * Screenshots of the pages a change touched, written into the build so they
 * deploy with the preview.
 *
 *   node screenshot.mjs dist [--base <sha>] [--all] [--tile-only]
 *
 * Output: dist/__preview/<page>-<width>.png for the home page and every HTML
 * page changed since `--base` (default: origin/main), at 390px and 1280px,
 * plus dist/__preview/index.json listing them. The portal shows the 390px
 * home shot beside the approve button; the pull request comment lists all.
 *
 * Always also writes dist/__preview/home-tile.png: the home page at 1280x720,
 * viewport only, which is the thumbnail the portal's client grid shows. It is
 * a separate shot rather than a reuse of home-1280.png because that one is
 * `fullPage` — a whole scrolling page squeezed into a 16:9 tile is a smear.
 * `--tile-only` produces just this one and skips the diff shots, which is what
 * a production deploy wants: no pull request to illustrate, but a thumbnail
 * that should refresh with every release.
 *
 * The tile is why a client site never needs to allow framing. The portal used
 * to iframe each live home page, which any site sending X-Frame-Options or
 * `frame-ancestors` refuses — a blank tile for a perfectly healthy site. A
 * picture taken at deploy time is as current as the deploy, costs the operator
 * nothing to load, and cannot be blocked.
 *
 * Requires Playwright (`npm i -g playwright@1.50.1 && playwright install
 * --with-deps chromium`); resolved from the global root so the client
 * repository carries no dependency. Serves dist/ itself on a local port.
 *
 * Deliberately generous with time: fonts load, preloaders clear, entrance
 * animations finish. Every shot waits for a floor and then for two identical
 * frames (see `settle`). A screenshot of a page mid-fade — or of its splash
 * screen — tells the client nothing.

 * Wait until the page stops changing, then shoot.

 * not hide its `#preloader` until 2.5s, so networkidle resolved around 1.2s and
 * the pause landed at ~2.0s — half a second short. The tile came out as a
 * picture of the splash screen often enough to matter, for a site that is
 * perfectly healthy. That is the same class of bug the tile replaced iframes
 * to avoid: the grid reporting a problem that does not exist.
 *
 * Two conditions, and both are needed:
 *
 *   - A floor. Frame comparison alone is not enough, because a *static* splash
 *     screen is itself two identical frames — the check would happily conclude
 *     the page had settled and photograph the splash. The floor is set past the
 *     preloaders actually seen in the wild rather than derived from anything.
 *   - Then stability: two consecutive byte-identical frames. This is what
 *     catches whatever the floor did not — entrance animations, late fonts,
 *     lazily loaded images — without knowing anything about the markup.
 *
 * A site with a permanently animating background never goes stable, so this is
 * capped and returns anyway. Reaching the cap is expected, not a failure, and
 * the screenshot is still taken. The JPEG is only ever compared, never written.
